They're also not lucky.\n\nThis player is decent at pitching. They are very powerful and very sharp, but not defiant and not convincing.\n\nThis player is decent at defense. They are very patient and extremely aware, but not nimble and not armed.\n\nBatting is a work in progress for this player. They are quite consistent and extremely strategic, but not disciplined and not accurate.\n\nThis player gets by on the basepaths. They are very aggressive, but not fast.",
