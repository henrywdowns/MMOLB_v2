Overall strategy:

batting: balance of OBP and ISO
pitching: 

====================================================================================

key regression findings:

batting:
win diff heavily tied to team ISO, BB%
- ISO tied to MUSCLE, LIFT ; secondarily VISION, INTIMIDATION, DETERMINATION
- BB% tied to DISCIPLINE, CONTACT(?); secondarily DETERMINATION

pitching:
win diff most tied to team K9, BB9
- K9 tied to VELOCITY, ROTATION
- BB9 heavily tied to ROTATION, CONTROL, PERSUASION

batting details:

i want to start with guys on base to set the table for sluggers to RBI; repeat this every 3-4 batters

1 Alfred Tanner - want him to be passive but has active stats. so he'll be a leadoff ISO/BA guy
2 Clarence Meyers - has no batting prowess. high discipline and cunning. walk man.
3 Mamie Mitra - slugger and RBI machine. muscle, lift, vision focus priority
4 Edna Santiago - somewhat neutral stats but still slugging oriented. fuck it, she slugs too
5 Nate Flowers - on-base boy. high discipline, high determination, high wisdom. all-knowing to boost all this and hopefully walk/single. maybe some determ -> viz.
6 Rick Somersbyshire - smack em and attack em. it's rick. no possible other plan. try to move into % muscle items and lift.
7 Jesse McNamara - pretty whatever even stats and no boons. move into walks for now
8 Charles Lyberth - unnecessarily high discipline. distribute into contact + determination
9 Eluna Shin - WIS into DISC and CONTACT
