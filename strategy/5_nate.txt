5th in line and follows some big hitters. he has generally weak stats and so i'd rather he 
just fuckin stand still and hope the pitcher has shitty control. 
he has all-knowing and decent determ so i'm kinda doing disc/viz/determ to see if he can tire out the pitcher, find a full count, and then walk?


20251127: reset and upped discipline and vision. i want him to watch balls and foul strikes! so far he is actually putting a lot of balls in play
which is unexpected but more than welcome
