4th in the lineup

another slugger and hopefully a good last shot at an RBI in the first or an early base in the second 

she has +30% musc/intim from insectoid but -30% disc/insight. i don't think insight matters all that much. 
--> i should crank up contact bc shes gonna be swinging at balls anyway, might as well fish for a ball in play

20251127: i reset and cranked muscle + vision which seems to work decently well. look for contact upgrades
