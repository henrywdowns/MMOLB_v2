my boy clarence is second in the lineup. he has no vision, no muscle
realistically, every good pitcher will knock him down
but he can count on most pitchers having middling control

so we crank up discipline and cunning to capitalize on early walks and set the table for third in the lineup

20251127: resetting and just fully cranking discipline. cunning is already naturally high for some reason.
          i'll plan to slowly up stealth and greed to try and put a runner on third as early in the game as possible.
